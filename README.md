ESPHome Geacko spa controller integration

Relative to [GeckoLib](https://github.com/gazoodle/geckolib) but instead of interfacing with a in.Touch2 WiFi addon device connecting directly to the spa main-board controller via an ESP8266 or ESP32 and likely some voltage level isolation.

For now it's an all-in-one package, but if it makes sense and interest is to widen the usage I'm upen to split it to to a domain independent interface library and an ESPHome specific usage.
